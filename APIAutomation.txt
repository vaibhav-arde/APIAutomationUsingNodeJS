API stand for Application Programming Interface.
It allows different applications to communicate and share data.
Transfer is between the host application (server) and the consumer application (Client).
To ensure quality and consistency the API process uses a number of protocols (like HTTP) and standards (REST).
The transfer of resources between connected applications is achieved using calls like Get, Post, Put and Delete, and each results in status code which confirms the output of the operation.
An authorization process is used to control who has accces to the API and can make request of it.

WEB SERVICE API :
A web service is a piece of a software, or a system, that provides access to its services via an address on a World Wide Web. This address is known as URI or URL.
Key point is that webservice offers its information in a format that other application can understand and parse.
WebService almost always involves communication over network and HTTP is the most commonly used protocol.

WebService API are of two kinds:
1. Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and 
2. Representational State Transfer (REST)

=====================================================================================================

REST API:
REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer.
REST applies a common defination and standard of API development for web based applications.
It is an architectural style or pattern of development of resource-oriented web applications.
REST architecture maps CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to get the set of operations supported by the web service using HTTP method (e.g. POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).
REST mostly uses HTTP protocol for transport of data, although it can use any other protocol as well.
REST permits different data formats such as Plain text, HTML, XML, JSON etc.

REST VS SOAP:
REST is just architectural style.
SOAP is complete protocol
REST is prefered now days just because of its simplicity, where as SOAP is more secure and complex.

HTTP Methods and Response Codes:
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communication between clients and server.
HTTP works as request-response protocol between a client and server.

GET:
a. Retrives info about the REST API resource
b. Doesn't change the state of the server (safe)
c. We don't submit any data/body.

POST:
a. Creats a new resource.
b. Changes the state of server (Unsafe)
c. We need to send a body.

PUT:
a. Updates an existing resource.
b. Changes the state of server (Unsafe)
c. We need to send a body.

DELETE:
a. Deletes an existing resource.
b. Changes the state of server (Unsafe)

HTTP Response Status Codes:
    Catagory                    Description                 
1xx : Informational     Communicates transfer protocol-level information
2xx : Success           Indicates that clients request was accepted successfully 
3xx : Redirectional     Indicates that client must take some additional action in order to complete their                          request.
4xx : Client Error      This catogory of error status codes points the finger at client
5xx : Server Error      The server takes responsibility for these error status codes.
        ----------------------------------------------------------
2xx : (200: OK, 201:Created, 202:Accepted, 204:No Content)
3xx : (300:Moved Permanently, 302:Found, 303:See Other, 304:NotModified, 307:Temporory Redirect)
4xx : (400:Bad request, 401:Unauthorised, 403:Forbidden, 404:Not Found, 405:Method Not Allowed, 406:Not Acceptable, 412:PreCondition Failed, 415:Unsupported Media types)

Understanding PostMan:

reqres.in

Request need BaseURL and endpoint.
