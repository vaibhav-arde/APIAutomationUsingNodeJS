API stand for Application Programming Interface.
It allows different applications to communicate and share data.
Transfer is between the host application (server) and the consumer application (Client).
To ensure quality and consistency the API process uses a number of protocols (like HTTP) and standards (REST).
The transfer of resources between connected applications is achieved using calls like Get, Post, Put and Delete, and each results in status code which confirms the output of the operation.
An authorization process is used to control who has accces to the API and can make request of it.
